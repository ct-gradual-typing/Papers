%% The problem:
%%   Not many mathematical models of gradual type systems especially categorical models.
%% Model gives us:
%%   - Connects existing work to gradual typing and the combination of dynamic and static typing
%%   - Can lead to simplifications of the language design: Core Grady does not depend on type consistency
%%   - A categorical model will help in the design of more powerful
%%     gradual type systems, for example, linear types, effects, polymorphism, dependent types, etc.

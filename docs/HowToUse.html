            <h2>Introduction to Grady</h2>
                <p>
                   Grady includes a Surface and Core Repl allowing users to experience the language from both a high and 
                   low level.  The Repl provides typechecking
                   of terms with helpful error messages, helping new users become accustomed to the language syntax.  We 
                   recommend that new users start with the Surface Repl as its syntax is simpler.
                   Additionally, Grady is a highly expressive language allowing everything from programming in 
                   untyped lambda-calculus to polymorphism.

                <h2>Repl Commands</h2>
                <h4>Used in either Repl</h4>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:help/:h</h3>
                    <p>
                       At any time in the Repl use this command to enter into the help menu.  From here you 
                       will see a list of all commands available.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:type/:t &lt;term&gt;</h3>
                    <p>
                       This command allows you to typecheck a term.  If the term typechecks, the term's type is 
                       returned.  If the term does not typecheck, then the appropriate error message is returned.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:show/:s &lt;term&gt;</h3>
                    <p>
                       The show command will display the abstract syntax type of the provided term.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:unfold/:u &lt;term&gt;</h3>
                    <p>
                       Unfold displays your term and where appropriate substitutes terms from 
                       the context into your term.  In this way a function that is composed of several
                       other functions can be seen in it entirety.  
                    </p>

                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:dump/:d</h3>
                    <p>
                       The dump command will display the terms in the context.  These will be displayed in the form
                       "let &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;term&gt;"
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>:load/:l &lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                    <p>
                       You may load an external file of definitions using this command.  These files are
                       requred to have the extention .gry.  The terms are all typedchecked and then add to the context 
                       where they are usable in the Repl.  The loading  s done lazily, so if you have several 
                       definitions in your external file and the third one does not typecheck, the first two 
                       will still be loaded into the context.

                    <h3>Variable binding</h3>
                    <p>
                       Binding a variable to a term is done with a "let" statement.  If you wanted to have a variable
                       named <strong>true</strong> bound to a term it would look like <strong>let true = \(p:?) -> \(q:?) -> p</strong>.
                       This means that the variable takes it two parameters of type <strong>?</strong>, which
                       is the untyped type, and returns an element of the same type.
                       
                       All bindings must typecheck.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>Simple Type</h3>
                    <p>
                       ?????
                    </p>

                <div class="command">
                    <h3>Natural Number Type</h3>
                    <p>
                       Any natural number.  The type is notated as <strong>Nat</strong>.<br>
                       An example: <strong>\(m:Nat)</strong><br>
                       This indicates that <strong>m</strong> has the Natural Number type.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>Unit Type</h3>
                    <p>

                    <h3>Untyped</h3>
                    <p>
                       This type represents the an element in the untyped universe.  Its notation is 
                       <strong>?</strong>.<br>
                       An example: <strong>\(m:?)</strong><br>
                       This indicates that <strong>m</strong> has the untyped type.
                    </p>

                <div class="command">
                    <h3>Function Type</h3>
                    <p>
                       This type allows Grady to represent functions using an arrow, <strong>-></strong>.<br>
                       An example: <strong>\(m:? -> ?)</strong><br>
                       In the example, <strong>m</strong> is a function that takes in an element of type
                       <strong>?</strong> and returns something of the same type.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>Product Type</h3>
                    <p>
                       The product type, notated as <strong>(,)</strong> takes two elements and maintains them
                       as a tuple.<br>
                       An example: <strong>\(m:(?,Nat))</strong><br>
                       Here you can see that <strong>m</strong> is a tuple of two elements.  The first
                       projection is of type <strong>?</strong> and the second projection is of type
                       <strong>Nat</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="command">
                    <h3>List Type</h3>
                    <p>
                       In Grady you may use lists using the List type.  It is denoted, <strong>[]</strong> with
                       items in the list separated by commas.  All items in the list must have the same type.<br>
                       For example: <strong>[1,2,3]</strong><br>
                       This is simply a list containing the natural numbers 1,2, and 3.

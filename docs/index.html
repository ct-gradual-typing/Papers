            <h2>What is Grady?</h2>
            <p>Gradual typing was first proposed by Siek and Taha in 2006 as a way for a programming language 
                to combine the strengths of both static and dynamic typing. However one question we must ask is,
                what is gradual typing? This paper contributes to answering this question by providing the 
                first categorical model of gradual typing using the seminal work of Scott and Lambek on the 
                categorical models of the untyped and typed lamb-calculus. We then extract a functional 
                programming language, called Grady, from the categorical model using the Curry-Howard-Lambek 
                correspondence that combines both static and dynamic typing.

            <h2>Website Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a nice summary of how to use the two Repls that Grady comes equiped with, the Surface and Core Repl.
                In the "How To Use Grady" section you will find a brief description of the commands used in both 
                Repls as well as the data types it can understand.  The section "Examples" contains some interesting
                examples that show the expressive power of the language.
